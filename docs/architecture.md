# Escoria architecture

## Classes and Autoload

Escoria is based on an autoload called [`escoria`](api/escoria.gd.md), that binds together all required objects and interfaces in a central place. An additional autoload, [`esctypes`](api/escoria_types.gd.md) defines basic escoria classes.

In addition to this, various classes are defined in the respective class files and build up the various resources used in Escoria.
